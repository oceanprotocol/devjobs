# üê† Senior UX Designer
[Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) builds tools for people to reclaim control of their data and unleash an open data economy. Ocean tools make it easy to publish & consume data services as ERC20 datatokens, and bridge data to DeFi. Ocean Market is a DEX tuned for data.

Ocean has a vibrant, expanding ecosystem of data suppliers, data consumers, stakers and community developers. To serve it better, we‚Äôre hiring! If you are someone that loves to design useful, good-looking interfaces and cares deeply about the future of data, we want to hear from you.

* You'll iterate with product management via suggestions for top-level stories, towards improving UX

## Skills and Experience

## Minimum Qualifications
